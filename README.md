Hi
This is a M2R project code. Apply model from Report 23: State-level tracking of COVID-19 in the United States Version 2 (28-05-2020) on California data. (Partially). 

Github link for original code:
https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model/releases/tag/v6.0 

Extra data sources:
https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/
http://www.usa.com/rank/california-state--population-density--county-rank.htm

Before running the process_data.R
There are many setnames(??,"锘縞ountyFIPS",'countyFIPS') in the code to cope with invalid data imported.
It should be deleted if the data are imported correctly on your computer.
